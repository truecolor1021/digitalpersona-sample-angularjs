# Bank of DigitalPersona sample

This sample shows typical usage scenarios of DigitalPersona Access Management (DPAM) APIs:

* creating and deleting a user account.
* enrolling and changing user credentials, such as password, fingerprints, cards, face, U2F tokens,
one-time password, PIN.
* multi-factor authentication (MFA) with enrolled credentials, driven by logon policies configured 
on the server.

The sample application uses NodeJS backend and AngularJS frontend, but DPAM APIs are vanilla
Typescript/Javascript libraries and will work with any JS framework.

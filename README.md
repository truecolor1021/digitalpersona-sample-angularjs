# Bank of DigitalPersona sample

The Bank of DigitalPersona sample web application shows typical usage scenarios of the
DigitalPersona Access Management (DPAM), such as:

* Creating and deleting user accounts.
* Enrolling and modifying user credentials, such as passwords, fingerprints, cards, facial, 
  FIDO (U2F) tokens, One-Time Passwords and PINs.
* Multi-factor authentication (MFA) with enrolled credentials, driven by logon policies configured on the server.

This sample application uses a NodeJS backend and and AngularJS frontend, but DPAM APIs are vanilla 
Typescript/Javascript libraries and will work with any JS framework.

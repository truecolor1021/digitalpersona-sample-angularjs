# Overview

As a part of {{site.data.product.shortName}}, the {{ site.data.lib.name }} shows typical usage scenarios of the {{ site.data.product.name }}, such as:

* Creating and deleting user accounts.
* Enrolling and modifying user credentials, such as passwords, fingerprints, cards, facial, FIDO (U2F) tokens, One-Time Passwords and PINs.
* Multi-factor authentication (MFA) with enrolled credentials, driven by logon policies configured on the server.

This sample application uses a NodeJS backend and and AngularJS frontend, but {{ site.data.product.shortName }}
APIs are vanilla Typescript/Javascript libraries and will work with any JS framework.

# Overview

As a part of {{site.data.product.shortName}}, the {{ site.data.lib.name }} shows typical usage scenarios of the {{ site.data.product.name }}, such as:

* Creating and deleting user accounts.
* Enrolling and modifying user credentials, such as passwords, fingerprints, cards, facial, FIDO (U2F) tokens, One-Time Passwords and PINs.
* Multi-factor authentication (MFA) with enrolled credentials, driven by logon policies configured on the server.

This sample application uses a NodeJS backend and and AngularJS frontend, but {{ site.data.product.shortName }}
APIs are vanilla Typescript/Javascript libraries and will work with any JS framework.

## Instructions

* [Prerequisites](./prereqs.md)
* [Build the server](./build.md)
* [Configure the server](./configure.md)
* [Run the server](./run.md)

## Known issues and limitations

* The sample does not auto-refresh an authenticated user's token. Some operations require a fresh token,
  and they will start returning "Token possibly expired" error about 10 minutes after sign in.
  Users must refresh their tokens by signing out and then signign back in.

* Microsoft Edge 40 (EdgeHTML 15.15063) has an issue with CORS (Cross-Origin Request Security) 
  in XHR/Fetch requests, causing a "Fetch failed" or "Network request failed" error.
  See more details [here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/12339859/).

* IE11 requires following polyfills:
    * fetch
    * Object.assign
    * String.prototype.endsWith
    * Array.prototype.findIndex
    * Array.prototype.includes
    * Symbol
    * TextEncoder/TextDecoder

One of possible methods is to add a following script to your page:
```html
<script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=Symbol%2Cfetch%2CString.prototype.endsWith%2CObject.assign%2CArray.prototype.findIndex%2CArray.prototype.includes"></script>
```

Also see [index.html]({{site.data.lib.git}}/{{site.data.lib.repo}}/src/index.html) for the `TextEncoder` polyfill.

* IE11 does not support WebRTC, so face recogintion in IE11 requires a polyfill for the `getUserMedia` API 
  which uses Adobe Flash as a fallback.

* IE11 does not support U2F.
